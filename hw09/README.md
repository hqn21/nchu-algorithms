## Description
Ojou-sama wants to buy a new smartphone. She is tired of using her Nokia 3310 for 20 years. In preparation for the possibility of venturing into an isekai with a smartphone, Ojou-sama has been gathering information on which smartphones would grant her the best abilities in such a scenario. She learned that battery capacity and signal strength are the most crucial features. Help Ojou-sama filter out the good smartphones from a large list. The input consists of unique elements, and each element contains two numbers representing a smartphone's battery capacity and signal strength. Given two elements A = (X_A, Y_A), and B = (X_B, Y_B), if X_A ≥ X_B and Y_A ≥ Y_B , then A is considered better than B. Given an element A, if there is no other element better than A, then A is called a good element. Your task is to filter out all the good smartphones. Note: The output must preserve the input order.

### Examples
**Example 1:**
> **Input:** phones = [[1, 1],[2, 4],[2, 10],[5, 4],[4, 8],[5, 5],[8, 4],[10, 2],[10, 1]]   
> **Output:** [[2, 10],[4, 8],[5, 5],[8, 4],[10, 2]]
